    Hello!
    eh,well,I have something to say at first.
    Our priority is to learn Atomic-Physics.So you can use English or Chinese when annotating,commenting,
criticizing and advising.
    After reading  the just sentence above,you had recognized that the writer wasn't from English-speaking country.
    Next,we accept any languages,whatever Python,C,C++,Java,Fortran,R...
    But, YOU'D BETTER PASTE THE OUTPUT OF YOUR PROGRAM AND HIGHLIGHT IT IN ORDER TO HELP OTHERS UNDERSTAND EASILY.
    Finally,enjoy the time you spend here.
